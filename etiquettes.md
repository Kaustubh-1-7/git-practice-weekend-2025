Following are the basic open source etiquettes and practises before contributing to an open source project.

1.Define ur motivation whether its a skill improvement or bug fixing etc. to enhance productivity and collaborations.

2.We should be kind and have respect towards other contributors, instead of criticizing others we should help them by giving suggestions.

3.We should avoid controversial topics and offensive language and maintain the topic that is relevant for a project.

4.We should contribute meaningfully by focusing on fixing issues, improving documentation, avoid unproductive contributions like unnecessary style changes or minor edits.

5.We should try to find answers independently before asking questions, use appropriate communication channels, such as forums or chat rooms, for general inquiries, and avoid cluttering issue trackers with simple questions.

6.We should submit clear and concise pull requests, targeting one issue per request, and participate in discussions, be patient when awaiting responses and avoid demanding immediate attention from busy contributors.

7.We should respect decisions made by contributors and moderators, if unable to dedicate time to a task we should inform others and seek assistance.
